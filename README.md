Final project of the 2nd FrauenLoop cycle on Test Automation - UI Automation for an ecommerce website
URL: http://automationpractice.com/index.php

After exploring the website, it came to my realization that the most painful thing about it is how many users can access the page .. in peace.
It's very often for me to not be able to load the page at all, let alone proceed further with common activities/basic steps on a ecommerce website.
Therefore, I would like to run a performance test on it with 100 users at a time by using Jmeter and see how many can get through.
